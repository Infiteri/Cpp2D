### IDEAS

will add ideas when come along

[ - ] Add camera origin point, make better interface for cameras along side transform when Transform is a thing
[ - ] Added engine config from file, or at least the flags and logging for it

Material planning:
config will have a filename and a name
add pls from file type stuff
Add pls unique materials some time yupi idk how but will do

a unique material is just a material loaded from a configuration thru code or smth like and not from file. (well its still saved in file but not a different file read. used for a one-time-use of the material or for a class that gets used over and over like a prefab when they are a thing)

geometry broski, maybe vertices are generated are at user preference (custom geometry / separated update / so no bad ...)

hear me out:
what if... geometry is custom maybe? like an array of vertices and stuff, no idea how to do indices but hey we will figure it out MAYBE
